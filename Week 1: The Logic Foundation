Theme: Solving Local Kenyan Problems with Data.

## Concept: Variables, Lists, Loops, Functions.

The Scenario: A local Sacco needs a system to check if a member qualifies for a loan.

The Project: "The Sacco Loan Calculator."

    Input: User enters their savings and requested loan amount.

    Logic: Create a Python function that checks if loan < (savings * 3).

    Deliverable: A .py script that runs in the terminal, asks for input, and prints "Approved" or "Rejected."
