# Concept: Handling NaN (empty values), Duplicates, String formatting.

The Scenario: A Nairobi shopkeeper recorded sales manually. Some prices have "Ksh" text mixed with numbers, and some days are missing.

The Project: "The Messy Shopkeeper."

    Dataset: A CSV with dirty data (e.g., Price: "1000", "1000ksh", "Zero", NaN).

    Task: Write code to strip the "ksh," convert text to numbers, fill missing values with the average, and remove duplicates.

    Deliverable: Export a clean clean_sales_data.csv file.
