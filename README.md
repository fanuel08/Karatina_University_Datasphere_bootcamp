## 🚀 About This Program
Welcome to the **Karatina Data Innovators** repository. This is not just a coding class; it is an incubator for technical problem solvers.

We operate on a dual-track system:
1.  **The Lab (Saturdays):** Hands-on technical training in Python, Data Science, and Machine Learning.
2.  **The Incubator (Weekdays):** Innovation strategy, Design Thinking, and Business Modeling.

**Our Mission:** To equip students with the technical skills to build intelligent systems and the strategic mindset to solve actual problems in our community.
