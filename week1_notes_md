# 🐍 Week 1: The Logic Foundation

**Topic:** Variables, Functions, Lists, & Control Flow
**Goal:** Build a reusable **Sacco Loan Calculator** that manages loans for multiple members.

---

## 📚 Part 1: The Toolkit (Key Concepts)

Before we build the app, we need to understand the tools.


### 1. Variables (The Containers)
Variables store data. In Python, the type is determined automatically.

```python code
name = "Wanjiku"       # String (Text)
savings = 5000         # Integer (Whole Number)
rate = 12.5            # Float (Decimal)
is_active = True       # Boolean (Yes/No)



### 2. Functions (Reusable Logic)

Instead of repeating code, we wrap logic in a function using def.
Python

def add_interest(amount):
    # Adds 10% interest
    return amount * 1.10

# Using the function
total = add_interest(1000) 

3. Lists (Storing Multiple Items)

A list allows us to store a collection of items.

#code
approved_members = ["Kamau", "Otieno"]

# Adding a new item
approved_members.append("Alice")



### 4. Loops (Repetition)

We use while loops to keep a program running until the user wants to stop.

# code
running = True
while running:
    print("System is ON...")
    # The loop continues until 'running' becomes False

###
🏆 Part 2: The Project — Sacco Loan System

The Scenario: A local Sacco needs a digital system to process loan applications. The system must run continuously, allowing the teller to process member after member without restarting the program.

The Business Rules:

    Eligibility: A member cannot borrow more than 3 times their current savings.

    Interest: The Sacco charges a flat 15% interest on all approved loans.

    Records: The system must keep a list of names for everyone who gets approved.

💻 The Solution Code

Create a file named sacco_system.py and paste this code to run the project.

    if loan_amount <= limit:
        return True
    else:

    """
    Rule: Add 15% Interest to the loan.
    """
    interest = loan_amount * 0.15
    return loan_amount + interest

# --- 2. THE MAIN SYSTEM LOOP ---

def main():
    print("--- 🏦 KARATINA SACCO DIGITAL SYSTEM 🏦 ---")
    
    # List to store names of people who get approved
    approved_list = []
    
    system_running = True

    while system_running:
        print("\n--- NEW APPLICATION ---")
        
        # Get Inputs (and convert strings to integers)
        try:
            name = input("Enter Member Name: ")
            savings = int(input("Enter Current Savings (Ksh): "))
            request = int(input("Enter Loan Request (Ksh): "))
        except ValueError:
            print("❌ Error: Please enter valid numbers for savings and loan.")
            continue # Skips to the start of the loop

        # Step A: Check Eligibility
        if check_eligibility(savings, request):
            
            # Step B: Calculate Repayment
            total_due = calculate_repayment(request)
            
            print(f"✅ APPROVED! Congratulations {name}.")
            print(f"💰 Amount Disbursed: Ksh {request}")
            print(f"📅 Total to Repay (with 15% interest): Ksh {int(total_due)}")
            
            # Step C: Add to records
            approved_list.append(name)
            
        else:
            print("❌ REJECTED.")
            print(f"Reason: You can only borrow up to Ksh {savings * 3}.")

        # Step D: Ask to continue
        choice = input("\nProcess another member? (y/n): ")
        if choice.lower() == 'n':
            system_running = False

    # --- 3. END OF SESSION REPORT ---
    print("\n" + "="*30)
    print(f"📊 SESSION CLOSED")
    print(f"Total Loans Approved: {len(approved_list)}")
    if len(approved_list) > 0:
        print("Approved Members:")
        for member in approved_list:
            print(f"- {member}")
    print("="*30)

# Run the program
if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()



##🚀 Part 3: Homework Challenge

"The VIP Upgrade"

Modify the code above to include a VIP Rule:

    Ask the user: "Are you a VIP member? (yes/no)"

    If they are VIP, they can borrow 5 times their savings.

    If they are Regular, they stay at 3x their savings.

Tip: You will need to update the check_eligibility function to accept a third argument!
